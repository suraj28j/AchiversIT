Question 1 : What is difference between fs.writeFile and fs.writeFileSync
Answer :     writeFile and writeFileSync. Both functions take a file path and data as arguments, and write the data to the specified file.
             [difference between the two functions:] 
             writeFile is asynchronous, while writeFileSync is synchronous This means that writeFile will return immediately,before the file has been written and only its callback will be called when the write operation is completed.
             while writeFileSync will block until the file has been written

Question 1 : What is difference between process.exit() and process.exitCode 
Answer :     process.exit() will exit as quickly as possible (after all 'exit' event listeners are called), even if there are pending async operations, including I/O operations.
             exitCode let the process exit gracefully when all operations have completed.
