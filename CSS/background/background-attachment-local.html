        <p>Welcome to the MDN beginner's JavaScript course! In this article we will look at JavaScript from a high
            level,
            answering questions such as "What is it?" and "What can you do with it?", and making sure you are
            comfortable
            with JavaScript's purpose.</p>

        <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages
            —
            every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at —
            displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes,
            etc. —
            you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web
            technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning
            Area.</p>

        <p>HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example
            defining
            paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.</p>

        <p>CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting
            background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.</p>

        <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control
            multimedia,
            animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can
            achieve
            with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</p>

        <p>APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would
            otherwise be hard or impossible to implement. They do the same thing for programming that ready-made
            furniture
            kits do for home building — it is much easier to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a
            bookshelf than it is to work out the design yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to
            the
            right size and shape, find the correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a bookshelf.</p>

        <p>Let's briefly recap the story of what happens when you load a web page in a browser (first talked about in
            our
            How CSS works article). When you load a web page in your browser, you are running your code (the HTML, CSS,
            and
            JavaScript) inside an execution environment (the browser tab). This is like a factory that takes in raw
            materials (the code) and outputs a product (the web page).</p>
